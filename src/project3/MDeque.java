/*
 * We learned about stacks, queues, and deques. An mdeque (pronounced "em-deck") 
 * is a variation of double ended queue that also provides a fast access to the 
 * middle element.

The documentation for all the required public methods that you need to implement 
is given at its javadoc page. You may implement additional methods, if you wish. 
They should be private, unless they are designed for use by the third parties. 
All methods need to be documented.

IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTIONS:

 All push…, pop…, and peek… methods should be O(1).
 The toString method should be implemented recursively.
 Your MDeque design needs to be based on a doubly linked list that you implement. 
 (It does not need to be inheriting from another class, you just need to use the 
 doubly linked list design. You will need to keep track of the middle of the mdeque
 in addition to the front and the back.)
 
 NOTES:
 	* A double ended queue or a deque is similar to a "normal" queue data structure
 	  but provides insertion and deletion at the front and back of the queue
